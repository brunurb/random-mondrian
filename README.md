# Random Mondrian

## Try it here https://lorenzoros.si/random-mondrian/

I like Mondrian, but it's very likely that I will be never able to afford one of his paintings.

I could learn how to paint (isn't art, after all, just stealing?) but I like coding more. Try the link and download your painting.
