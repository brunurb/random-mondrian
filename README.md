# Random Mondrian

I like Mondrian, and I really like Bauhaus art, but it's very likely that I will be never able to afford one of his paintings. But what if i *reaaaally* wanted one of his artworks?

I could learn how to paint (isn't art, after all, just stealing?) but I can't. I do, however, like coding.

Try the link and download your **custom made, persoal** Mondrian painting.
