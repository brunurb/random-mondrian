I like Mondrian, as I really like Bauhaus art, and it's very likely that I will be never able to afford one of his paintings. But what if i really wanted one of his artworks?⠀
You could say that I should buy a cheap replica, or an even cheaper print. And that would make a awesome lot of sense. But, you know me. Or not. Just keep reading.⠀
I could learn how to paint, and steal his style (isn't art, after all, just stealing?) but I can't. I do, however, like coding. So instead of going out and looking for an art shop (or just googling a painting and turning my printer on), I just decided that I would code yet another something to generate custom-made, hand-tailored, procedurally-generated faux mondrian-esque paintings. Wow that's a lot of buzzwords.⠀
What do you think of it?⠀
